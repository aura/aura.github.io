Aura Framework
==============

Unlike every other Aura package, the Aura Framework package *does* have dependencies.  This is because it composes them into a unified framework for development.  You probably don't want to download this directly; more likely, you want the [system repository](https://github.com/auraphp/system) for a project skeleton.
