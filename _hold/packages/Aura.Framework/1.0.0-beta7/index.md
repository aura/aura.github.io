Aura Framework
==============

Unlike every other Aura package, the Aura Framework package *does* have
dependencies. This is because it composes them into a unified framework for
development. You probably don't want to download this directly; more likely,
you want the [system repository](https://github.com/auraphp/system) for a
project skeleton.

This package is compliant with [PSR-0][], [PSR-1][], and [PSR-2][]. If you
notice compliance oversights, please send a patch via pull request.
