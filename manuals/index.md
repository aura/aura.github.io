# Framework Manuals

While Aura is primarily centered around its library packages, we do provide frameworks built from those libraries.

## Version 2.x

You can read the 2.x framework manual in [English](/manuals/2.0/en) or [Japanese](/manuals/2.0/ja).

## Version 1.x

We recommend using the 2.x framework; the 1.x manual is retained for archival purposes.

You can read the 1.x framework manual in [English](/manuals/v1/en) or [Japanese](/manuals/v1/ja). (It has been partially translated to [German](/manuals/v1/de) as well.)
